# About the project

There are many great resume websites available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this one. I want to create a resume website template so attractive with usefull info about your carrier.





Here's why:

- Resume website should have <ins>attractive and majestic theme</ins>.
- Resume website should have <ins>timeline section that shows your carrier</ins>.
- Resume website should have <ins>licences/badges section that shows your educations</ins>.
- Resume website should have <ins> a good big image of you which looks cool</ins> ðŸ˜‰.
